  abstract  = {Face recognition algorithms have to deal with significant amounts of illumination variations between gallery and probe images. State-of-the-art commercial face recognition algorithms still struggle with this problem. We propose a new image preprocessing algorithm that compensates for illumination variations in images. From a single brightness image the algorithm first estimates the illumination field and then compensates for it to mostly recover the scene reflectance. Unlike previously proposed approaches for illumination compensation, our algorithm does not require any training steps, knowledge of 3D face models or reflective surface models. We apply the algorithm to face images prior to recognition. We demonstrate large performance improvements with several standard face recognition algorithms across multiple, publicly available face databases.},

  abstract = {We describe software whose ultimate aim is to make measurements from a grey-scale image of a face. Cognitive psychologists have investigated human face recognition: we combine these insights with pattern recognition methods for computer face recognition. An application for our programs is in mug-shot retrieval; a subject sees a face, and is subsequently asked to guide a search for it from a large face database by providing a number of judgemental ratings. As each face is added to the database, 37 measurements of size and shape have to be made. Our software is designed to automate much of this. We describe algorithms used for extracting facial features such as head outline, location of eyes, eyebrows and mouth from a grey-scale image of the face. The methods involve first obtaining curves from edge detectors, and then combining and inducing them as necessary. Our approach is in part a multiresolution one; knowledge of appropriate positions of features at a given resolution is used to guide searches at finer resolutions. The results so far are encouraging; some measurements can be made accurately with a high probability of success, while failure, when it occurs, is recognised as such.},

The experimental results show that the proposed Eye Aspect Ratio Mapping can classify blinks with high accuracy at a low cost. We also found a strong correlation between the median SBR (Spontaneous Blink Rate) and the time between the objective estimation of eye fatigue and the subject's awareness of eye fatigue.},
